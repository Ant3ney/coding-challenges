## How it was made

This replica of the "No. VI / Composition No. II" painting was built by defininging a CSS Grid template where the length of each row / column was based on percentages I defined. The Grid container contains a dark background color and each brick takes up space based on the grid-column and grid-row CSS properties. The container of the replica will obtain a display none-CSS property when the size of the screen is below 600px and a new container will become visible. This new container is called the small container. It has only one column and it contains same sized rectangles each with different colors but are always grouped near rectangles of similar color.
